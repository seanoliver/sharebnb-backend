## Breaking Changes

- Upload images route is now POST /upload/image
- Start backend server with `nodemon server.js` instead of `nodemon app.js`
- Image upload is technically optional

## Outstanding

- [ ] Upload image still adds full AWS URL to database
- [ ] Need to implement conversation routes / functionality
- [ ] Add checks for correct listing owner (not sure if this is middleware)
- [ ] Add checks for in conversation (not sure if this is middleware)

## Deployment

- [X] Complete ElephantSQL setup
- [ ] Resolve issue with Render
- [ ] Link ElephantSQL to Render and push seed data
- [ ] Link AWS S3 to Render
